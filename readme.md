## üìù Note:
The spider is set to loop through 20 pages of the top anime list (self.iterations < 19). 1 page has 50 titles, so scraping 20 pages will generate 1000 records. You can adjust this value based on your requirements.

Remember to respect the website's terms of service and rate-limit your requests to avoid overloading their server. Happy scraping! üï∑Ô∏è
